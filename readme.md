### Run latest version of the whole project
Run docker-compose in the root directory
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```
It will take some time to build the first time, and to start all services.
afterwards you can visit the frontend at http://localhost:8080, the java backend at http://localhost:7080, the python processing at http://localhost:4080, and the mongodb server is running at localhost:27017.
