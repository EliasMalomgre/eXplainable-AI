## Overview
The MongoDb is used to store references to and information about files in the file storage. At the moment a MongoDb docker container is used but by changing the connection string in Spring core, a cloud database can be used.

## Run Mongo database
Execute the command `docker-compose up -d` in the folder `mongodb`. After executing this command a MongoDB will start on `port 27017`.

## Connect to Mongo database
You can get access to the database by using the following the following credentials:
- Username: `XAI`
- Password: `InfoSupportXAI`
- Hostname: `localhost`
- Port: `27017`
- Authentication: `Username / Password`
- Authentication Database: `admin`

Or use the following connection string:
- `mongodb://XAI:InfoSupportXAI@localhost:27017/?authSource=admin`
