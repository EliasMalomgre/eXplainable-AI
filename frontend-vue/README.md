## Introduction
This project houses the front end for the XAII application. Utilising the Vue framework.

## Project Overview
The vue front end is the sole UI responsible for allowing the user to run the application. It allows the user to upload trained artificial intelligence models and associated data. Once uploaded the user can request explanation plots for the given model, this request will be handled by the spring core. Once processed the user will be able to view the requested plot, along with others on the corresponding page. The front end also contains informative pages to educate the user on how to use the application and interpret the results. This application is also PWA compatible.

### Used technologies
- **Quasar** -> Component framework used throughout the entire project
- **ThreeJS** -> WebGL framework used for the visualisation of the AI's inner structure
